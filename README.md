###Calculation methods for non linear equations:
* method Chord
* method of Tangent
###Calculation method for non linear systems - method of Newton
Available equations to solve:
* x^2 - 2 = 0
* 5/x - 2x = 0
* e^2x - 2 = 0
* x^3 - x + 4 = 0

Available equations for system to solve:
* 0.1x^2 + x + 0.2y^2 - 0.3 = 0
* 0.2x^2 + y - 0.1xy - 0.7 = 0
* x + y - x^2 - 5 = 0
* 3y + 2x^3 - 2 = 0
* 2x^2 - y + 4z = 0
* sin(x) - sin(y) - sin(z) = 0
* x + y^2 / 2 - 2z = 0
* 2x - 4zy + 5 = 0

Сalculations occur with user-defined accuracy.

p.s. I hate this lab and work with graph
